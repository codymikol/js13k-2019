Theme: Back

The game will be a 2D point and click adventure game that satires the current state of "Lootcrate" and "Pay to Win" gameplay. 

###Initial Scope

Animated Title Screen that fits theme

Crawling Credits screen

Five levels of gameplay that feature increasingly challenging "Monkey Island" style of point and click adventure. Each level completion will be blocked by some antagonist who will offer you the opportunity to exchange money for level completion. 

## Level One

The first level will be a very small empty room with a guard standing at the end of the room. There is a large sword mounted on the opposite wall. The user is initially presented with two options.

##### The Guard

#### 1. Talk to the Guard.

If the user chooses to talk to the guard they will be presented with the option to pay for entry to the next level or they can refuse.

If they choose to pay the guard negative visual effects will be added and the player will immediately be transported to Level Two.

If they refuse the sword behind the player will fall partially off the wall.

Another refusal will cause the sword to fully fall off the wall.

The player then has to decide between killing the guard to move on or paying money.

#### 2. Pull at the sword on the wall.

The sword will break off the wall a bit. If the player pulls again it will fall off the wall allowing the player to pick it up off the floor and add it to their inventory.

The sword can be used to kill the guard and collect his viking hat cosmetic. moving forward to level two

# Things TODO:

Create some too to quickly create / load visual vector assets.

Create a filter that can overlay the game and increases color / saturation or goes to grayscale

Figure out how the theme is incorporated in the overall storyline...

## Stretch Goals

Add a KSynth package to game-kiln for the stretch goal of music.
